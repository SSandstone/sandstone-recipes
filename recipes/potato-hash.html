    <h1>Potato Hash</h1>
    <img src="../recipe-imgs/potato-hash" alt="chopped, lightly fried potatoes with onions and bacon in a bowl">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>There's nothing as classic and simple as a potato hash. It's been my go to, 'well I don't know what the hell to make for breakfast/lunch/dinner today...' recipe for years now. And let me tell you, that sentiment of not knowing what to make is a near daily occurence when I'm balancing a job, school, and some semblance of a social life.</p>
    <p>This recipe is as simple as dicing up potatoes and throwing them in a pan with a little oil for a bit. I throw in some other stuff, like eggs, mushrooms, bacon, butter, onions, etc. but it's really all optional. Not to mention potatoes are dirt cheap and fill you up like nobody's business. One of my all time favorites.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I mean... a potato. I like to go with a nice medium to large yellow potato personally, diced up into tiny pieces. Any will work though.</li>
        <li>1 sliced white onion</li>
        <li>2 strips of bacon (I like turkey bacon)</li>
        <li>1 cup of shredded cheese</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>(Optional) Mushrooms or veggies of choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>dice up the potato into a size you like. The thinner or smaller the pieces the faster it will cook!</li>
        <li>lightly coat a pan with oil and let it get hot</li>
        <li>toss in the potatoes and sprinkle some salt</li>
        <li>I like mine crispy, so I let the bottoms fry</li>
        <li>In a separate pan, cook your bacon strips to desired crispiness</li>
        <li>Once potatoes are browned, toss in sliced onion, cheese, veggies, and crack two eggs into the pan</li>
        <li>sprinkle a bit of water into the pan and put a lid on it. This will steam to make the potatoes soft, melt the cheese, and spread the flavor</li>
        <li>cut up the cooked bacon strips into pieces</li>
        <li>remove the pan cover, top with bacon, and voila!</li>
    </ol>
